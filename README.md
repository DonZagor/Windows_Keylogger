# Windows_Keylogger
This is a simple windows keylogger.
ONLY USE IT FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES!
I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU TRY TO USE FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES!
To run, run only .pyw file. This way the keylogger will run in the background without a GUI.
To end the task, go to Task Manager, find a python task and end it.
This will only work if Windows 10 antivirus is off.
You can also find the .py files to inject this keylogger into a .jpg image and decode it again into simple text. 
In order to run it from a .jpg image you need to run the decoding script and copy the contents into a new .pyw file.\
You can use any image, I have left here a sample one.
